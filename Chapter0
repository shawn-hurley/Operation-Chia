In the museums, they talk about how people back then used to have names for time. Like a god they worshipped it, their society built around doing things around a certain when. Everywhere they built shrines with mechanical hands and inhuman faces, maybe to reassure themselves that things they could control it. That somehow humans were better now and ever before and things were always going to be like they were now. These days, we only call time two names: the Beginning and the End. It's simpler that way- and unless you were around back then like Grandmam and Pap it's not like you miss the way things were before the Simplifying anyways. I like it better this way. Don't think; just live.
